Knk is also required for the laminar organization of chitin in the procuticle. During a bioinformatics search using this protein sequence as the query, we discovered the existence of a small family of three <italic>Knk</italic>-like genes (including the prototypical <italic>TcKnk</italic>) in the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> genome as well as in all insects with completed genome assemblies. The two additional <italic>Knk</italic>-like genes have been named <italic>TcKnk2</italic> and <italic>TcKnk3</italic>. Further complexity arises as a result of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation of transcripts of <italic>TcKnk3</italic>, leading to the production of three transcripts (and by inference, three proteins) from this gene. These transcripts are named <italic>TcKnk3-Full Length</italic> (<italic>TcKnk3-FL</italic>), <italic>TcKnk3-5&#x02032;</italic> and <italic>TcKnk3-3&#x02032;</italic>. All three <italic>Knk</italic>-family genes appear to have essential and non-redundant functions. RNAi for <italic>TcKnk</italic> led to developmental arrest at every molt, while down-regulation of either <italic>TcKnk2</italic> or one of the three <italic>TcKnk3</italic> transcripts (<italic>TcKnk3</italic>-3&#x02032;) resulted in specific molting arrest only at the pharate adult stage. All three <italic>Knk</italic> genes appear to influence the total chitin content at the pharate adult stage, but to variable extents. While <italic>TcKnk</italic> contributes mostly to the stability and laminar organization of chitin in the elytral and body wall procuticles, proteins encoded by <italic>TcKnk2</italic> and <italic>TcKnk3</italic>-<italic>3&#x02032;</italic> transcripts appear to be required for the integrity of the body wall denticles and tracheal taenidia, but not the elytral and body wall procuticles. Thus, the three members of the Knk-family of proteins perform different essential functions in cuticle formation at different developmental stages and in different parts of the insect anatomy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>We have identified two additional members of the family of Knickkopf (Knk)-like proteins in the genome of the red flour beetle as well as in all insect species with completely sequenced genomes. The previously characterized member of this family, TcKnk, protects chitin in the newly forming cuticle (exoskeleton) from degradation by the chitinase enzyme present in the molting fluid. Knk is also required for the laminar organization of the chitin polymer in the cuticle. The two newly identified members of this family, TcKnk2 and TcKnk3, have distinctly different but related functions. They are essential for adult morphogenesis including specialized &#x0201c;Velcro-like&#x0201d; cuticular denticles found in the lateral body wall, as well as the proper development of the tracheal lining. The <italic>TcKnk3</italic> gene gives rise to multiple transcripts as a result of alternative polyadenylation and/or splicing, but only one of these transcripts is essential for adult development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by NSF grant IOS-1022227 to SM and a Basic Science Research Program of National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant (NRF-2012R1A2A1A01006467) to YA.

Chitin, the major component of the procuticle, is synthesized by the integral membrane protein, chitin synthase-A (Chs-A) and is deposited outside of the cell in the form of bundles of fibers <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Merzendorfer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004537-Merzendorfer2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

In some parts of the procuticle, successive layers of chitin sheets are deposited in such a way that the horizontal axes of adjacent laminae follow a helical path <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Moussian1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Several groups of cuticle-associated proteins have been implicated in organizing the cuticle into a complex multi-layered structure with distinctly different properties in different parts of the insect's body plan <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Arakane1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004537-Jasrapuria1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The role, if any, of specific cuticular and epidermal cell plasma membrane proteins in organizing chitin laminae into such helicoidal or orthogonal bundles has not been investigated in detail.</p><p>During development, in addition to cuticle growth, insects have to undergo a process of molting, during which old cuticle is replaced by a new one. Chitinases present in the molting fluid degrade chitin from the old cuticle, providing substrate for the new cuticle synthesis <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Locke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004537-NobleNesbitt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004537-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our recent study with the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, has shown co-localization of chitinase (chitinase-5) with chitin in the newly synthesized procuticle leading to the paradoxical situation where the nascent chitin needs protection from degradation by chitinases present in the molting fluid <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Chaudhari1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The presence of a chitin-binding protein, Knickkopf (Knk), in the developing new procuticle was shown to be important for protecting chitin from degradation by active chitinases <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Chaudhari1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Knk</italic> was initially identified in a search for mutants defective in cuticle integrity in developing embryos of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>

Although the exact mechanism of protection of chitin by Knk remains unclear, its ability to bind to chitin was predicted to lead to a masking effect that prevents chitin from degradation by chitinases. Furthermore, Knk was also shown to be important for cuticle integrity and laminar organization of the embryonic procuticular chitin in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>

RNA interference (RNAi) studies reveal important roles of these two additional <italic>Knk</italic>-family genes in embryonic as well as post-embryonic stages of development that are distinctly different from those of Knk. The protein products of these two genes are required for the maintenance of the integrity of cuticular structures in the body wall denticles and tracheal taenidia. A bioinformatics search of genomes of other insects indicate the presence of orthologs of <italic>TcKnk2</italic> and <italic>TcKnk3</italic> in all other insect species examined, suggesting conserved essential functions for these orthologs during insect cuticle morphogenesis in specialized cuticular structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification Of <italic>Tcknk</italic>-Like Genes From <italic>T.

By RT-PCR using a pair of primers located at the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the deduced <italic>TcKnk3</italic> mRNA and cDNA from the pharate adult stage as template, we obtained a long cDNA fragment with a size of &#x0223c;4 kb. We cloned this cDNA fragment and randomly chose two clones for sequencing. Sequence comparisons of cDNA clones (both had exactly the same sequence) and the mRNA sequence predicted by the NCBI gene model for this gene (<italic>XM_963619</italic> with 8 exons) indicated that they were in agreement except for the absence of a 55 nucleotide-long stretch in the last exon in these two cDNA clones. We have designated this &#x0201c;missing&#x0201d; stretch as &#x0201c;exon 8a&#x0201d; and the rest of the last exon as exon 9. We have named the transcript lacking this exon as <italic>TcKnk3-Full Length-1</italic> (<italic>TcKnk3-FL-1</italic>) (KF475700) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Inspection of the sequences flanking this 55 nucleotides-long presumptive exon 8a indicated that it has the potential to be an intron because it begins with 5&#x02032;-GT&#x02014; and ends in &#x02014;CAG-3&#x02032; as expected of typical introns. To determine whether some <italic>TcKnk3</italic> transcripts lack this exon 8a sequence as predicted by the NCBI model, we used the same pharate adult cDNA template that was used to obtain the two long cDNA clones for additional PCR reactions using primers flanking exon 8a. We could obtain two amplified DNA fragments differing in size using these primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004537.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Sequencing of the larger fragment indicated that it had all 55 nucleotides of &#x0201c;exon 8a&#x0201d; sequences. We have named this transcript as <italic>TcKnk3-Full Length-2</italic> (<italic>TcKnk3-FL-2</italic>) (KF475701) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The relative abundances of these two PCR amplification products indicated that the transcripts without exon 8a predominate at the pharate adult stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004537.s001">Fig. S1</xref> A). Therefore, this 55 nucleotide stretch is indeed present only in a minority of mature transcripts, at least at this stage of development. Inclusion of this intron results in the read-through of exon 8a, a shift in reading frame, and extension of the ORF to a stop codon farther down-stream, leading to a much larger protein. The predicted lengths of TcKnk3-FL-1 and TcKnk3-FL-2 are 731 and 1205 amino acids, respectively. They share the first 728 amino acids starting from the N-terminus, differing only in the C-terminal region. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004537.s002">Fig. S2</xref> shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the Knk3 proteins encoded by these two transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Alternative Splicing/polyadenylation Yields A Shorter Transcript Derived From The 5&#x02032;-Part Of <italic>Tcknk3</italic> Gene</title><p>3&#x02032;-RACE using a forward primer in exon 5 and oligo (dT) as the reverse primer revealed the presence of polyadenylated RNAs with two distinct sizes. One had a size of &#x0223c;4 kb consistent with that predicted from the gene model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, while the other was much shorter than the full length mRNAs for <italic>TcKnk3</italic> (with or without exon 8a). We have cloned the cDNA corresponding to this short transcript as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section and named this transcript <italic>TcKnk3-5&#x02032;</italic> (KF475702). <italic>TcKnk3-5&#x02032;</italic> cDNA is 1942 nucleotides long and includes an ORF of 1209 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 403 amino acids (45.6 kDa) and a pI of 9.28. The N-terminal 263 amino acid sequence of this encoded protein was identical to that of the full-length protein predicted by the NCBI gene model, but included an additional 141 amino acids at its C-terminus not present in the predicted products of the longer clones. Nucleotide sequence comparisons with the <italic>TcKnk3</italic> genomic sequence indicated that <italic>TcKnk3-5&#x02032;</italic> cDNA is the result of an alternative splicing event that led to the inclusion of an exon (named exon 5a) and a polyadenylation site encoded within intron 5 of the NCBI gene model. Indeed, there is a polyadenylation signal 26 nucleotides upstream of the poly-A tail of this shorter 5&#x02032;-transcript. The inclusion of exon 5a, which is 1156 nucleotides long, resulted in the translation of the 141 codons not present in the two full-length mRNAs (FL-1 and FL-2). This RNA contains in addition to the first 5 exons of <italic>TcKnk</italic>, an additional exon that we have designated as &#x0201c;exon 5a&#x0201d; with a 3&#x02032;-UTR of 733 nucleotides (including the stop codon but excluding the poly A tail) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Northern Blot Analysis Reveals The Presence Of An Additional Transcript From The 3&#x02032;-Half Of The <italic>Tcknk3</italic> Gene</title><p>To confirm the presence of the long and short transcripts identified above as well as to investigate the possibility of additional transcripts for the <italic>TcKnk3</italic> gene due to alternative splicing and/or polyadenylation, we performed a Northern blot analysis using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes derived from the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;- regions of the <italic>TcKnk3</italic> gene as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section. We anticipated that our chance to detect minor transcripts corresponding to the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-regions of the gene could be enhanced by selectively down-regulating the steady state levels of one or more of the above-described transcripts using dsRNAs targeting exons either in the 5&#x02032;- half or the 3&#x02032;-half of this gene. Aliquots (10 &#x000b5;g) of total RNA extracted from pharate adult insects injected with control (<italic>TcVer</italic>), <italic>TcKnk3</italic> exon 9 or <italic>TcKnk3</italic> exon 5 dsRNA were used for Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Hybridization with the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 5&#x02032;-probe (exon1-exon5 region) detected a &#x0223c;4 kb transcript in control RNA (extracted from <italic>TcVer</italic> dsRNA-treated insects), a result consistent with the sizes of the two <italic>TcKnk3-FL</italic> cDNA clones that we have sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). No other transcripts with smaller sizes were detected. However, in RNA extracted at the same developmental stage from animals treated with exon 9 dsRNA (designed to suppress the full length transcript), the 5&#x02032;-probe detected only the shorter <italic>TcKnk3-5&#x02032;</italic> transcript. The absence of the full-length (<italic>TcKnk3-FL</italic>) transcript in this RNA preparation confirmed that we are indeed detecting only the <italic>TcKnk3</italic>-specific transcripts and not transcript of closely related <italic>TcKnk</italic> and <italic>TcKnk2</italic> genes. In RNA from animals treated with dsRNA for exon 5, neither the full-length 4 kb transcript nor the <italic>TcKnk3-</italic>5&#x02032; transcript were detected as expected, but surprisingly a slightly larger band (&#x0003e;2 kb) was detected. In a second experiment with a duplicate blot of the same three RNAs, a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled <italic>TcKnk3</italic>-3&#x02032; fragment was used as the hybridization probe. The 3&#x02032;-probe also detected the <italic>TcKnk3-FL</italic> transcript in the control RNA and its level was undetected after administration of exon 9-specific dsRNA as expected. Once again, the shorter transcripts were not detected in this RNA. Surprisingly, there was a strong autoradiographic band corresponding to the &#x0003e;2 kb-long transcript in the blot probed with the 3&#x02032;-probe. Compared to the control RNA in which the 3&#x02032;-transcripts were undetectable (lane labeled V), there was substantial up-regulation of the steady-state level of this transcript when the transcripts for the full-length and <italic>5&#x02032;-TcKnk3</italic> transcripts were down-regulated by exon 5-specific dsRNA (lane labeled E5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We presume that this transcript is derived predominantly from the 3&#x02032;-half of the <italic>TcKnk3</italic> gene, as it does not hybridize with the 5&#x02032;-probe.

Upon RNAi with dsRNAs for downstream exons, this short transcript might have been depleted leading to the observed phenotypes. Since we found exon 8a sequences in a minority of transcripts, we also investigated whether dsRNA for this exon could yield the same phenotype as exon 8-specific dsRNA. About 65% of the insects injected with exon 8a dsRNA exhibited mortality at the pharate adult stage and 15% of the surviving adults had a weaker phenotype similar to that observed after exons 6, 8 and 9 dsRNA treatments, indicating that transcripts with exon 8a are critically important for development and molting. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from insects treated with dsRNA for exon 8a indicated that this treatment did not result in visible depletion of the full-length transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). RT-PCR analysis using primer pairs flanking exon 8a specifically designed to detect transcripts with and without exon 8a indicated that exon 8a dsRNA specifically depleted only the transcripts containing exon 8a without appearing to affect those without this sequence. These data further suggest that transcripts without exon 8a (whether full length or shorter transcripts) are not essential for survival of the insects during the pupal-adult transformation.

TEM of elytra from control (<italic>TcVer</italic>)-dsRNA-treated insects revealed a horizontally arranged laminar organization of the procuticular chitin, that is, parallel to the apical surface of the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g008">Fig. 8</xref>; panel E1). RNAi of <italic>TcKnk</italic> resulted in the loss of laminar organization of the elytral cuticle (Panel E2). A similar loss of laminar organization of chitin was also observed under the denticle-like structures associated with specific regions of the lateral body wall, which interlock with corresponding regions on the inner side of the elytra (compare panels D1 and D2), which we denote as &#x0201c;Velcro&#x0201d; (Arakane et al., unpublished data). These Velcro-like denticles have hooked structures and that are complementary to specialized structures found in specific regions of the elytra capable of interactions similar to fibers of &#x0201c;Velcro&#x0201d; that snap them together tightly. In addition, electron dense material accumulates under these folds (indicated by black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).

There are many potential causes of gross elytral malformations beyond disruption of laminar architecture as we have reported previously in insects after RNAi of genes for neuropeptides and their receptors <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Arakane2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Because <italic>TcKnk3</italic>-3&#x02032; transcripts containing exon 8a sequences are also predicted to encode a protein containing the cleavable GPI-anchor, Knk3-protein may also associate with chitin in specialized cuticles such as body wall &#x0201c;Velcro denticles&#x0201d; and the taenidia.

Our most important finding was that RNAi of <italic>TcKnk3</italic> transcripts using exon 8a dsRNA resulted in molting arrest and lethality at the pharate adult stage. RT-PCR analysis indicated that this dsRNA treatment did not affect the levels of transcripts without exon8a. Thus it appeared that either full-length transcripts with exon 8a and/or truncated transcripts with exon 8a may be the only transcripts essential for survival and molting at the pharate adult stage. On the other hand, a nearly complete loss of the <italic>TcKnk3-FL</italic> transcript (along with the <italic>TcKnk3</italic>-5&#x02032;-transcripts), brought about using dsRNA for exon 5 (or upstream exons) of this gene, did not result in mortality or any visible phenotypes indicating that none of the longer transcripts (and the <italic>TcKnk3</italic>-5&#x02032;-transcripts) and their translation products are essential for survival and/or molting. Therefore, the lethality associated with the loss of transcripts with the exon 8a sequences must be entirely due to short transcripts (i.e. lacking exons 1 through 5). Unfortunately we were unable to determine the precise start point of this short transcript because the only region where we could design the reverse primer for the 5&#x02032;-RACE is the 55 nucleotide-long exon 8a. 5&#x02032;-RACE reactions using two reverse primers from exon 8a- and from exon 9 failed to identify the transcription start point even when we used total RNA depleted of <italic>TcKnK3</italic> full length and <italic>5&#x02032;</italic>-transcripts (using dsRNA for exon 5) as the template. We believe that this transcript starts downstream of exon 5 based on the RNAi results described earlier. Other strategies for identifying the start site of TcKnk3-3&#x02032; transcripts using forward primers designed in intron 5 also were unsuccessful.</p><p>The inclusion of exon 8a results in a shift of the open reading frame. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004537-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, the protein is altered to have a unique C-terminus that includes a GPI anchor. Transcripts without exon 8a predominate at most developmental stages (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004537.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The exception is during the mid-pupal stage when the isoform of the Knk3 protein encoded using exon 8a is expected to peak. This is on or around pupal day 2&#x02013;3, which just precedes the time point when developmental arrest occurs using exon 8a dsRNA. Interestingly, <italic>TcKnk3</italic> orthologs of other insect species are predicted to encode proteins that are highly similar to this long additional stretch of &#x0003e;400 amino acids found in TcKnk3 protein derived from read-through of exon 8a. We have carried out a careful analysis of preview data from the developmental stage time course transcriptional profiling with RNA-seq in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (modENCODE Project led by Sue Celniker <xref rid="pgen.1004537-Celniker1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) publicly available in Flybase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/dmelrnaseq/">http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/dmelrnaseq/</ext-link>). RNA Seq data of the DmKnk3 ortholog, Skeletor R-E, supports the notion that a similarly placed 55 nucleotide-long exon equivalent to TcKnk3 exon 8 in this gene leads to variation in the relative abundance of transcripts with and without this putative alternatively spliced exon in this dipteran species as well.</p><p>It should be pointed out that the truncated TcKnk3 protein derived from the shorter transcript with exon 8a sequences will be missing the two N-terminal DM13 domains but still have the DOMON domain, exon 6 through 8 derived sequences and additional exon 9-encoded sequences at the C-terminus derived from read-through of exon 8a. This read-through will not occur in transcripts that are devoid of exon 8a because the ribosomes encounter an in-frame stop codon very close to the beginning of exon 9. Since this longer protein is predicted to have a GPI anchor, it may be destined for transport to the plasma membrane. At present, we have been unable to identify whether it has an N-terminal signal peptide sequence to allow this protein to enter the ER. Absence of an antibody specific for this protein also precludes determination of the precise cellular location of this protein at present. Since the TcKnk3-FL-1 protein is the predominant form at most developmental stages and yet appears to be dispensable for survival, the sequences present in the C-terminal part of the TcKnk3 protein and/or the presence of the C-terminal GPI anchor may be critically important for metamorphosis at the pharate adult stage.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Alternative Splicing Of Exon 8a Of Tcknk3 Is Developmentally Regulated</title><p>Of the three members of the <italic>Knk</italic> gene family, only <italic>Knk3</italic> is known to have the potential to give rise to alternatively spliced transcripts.
