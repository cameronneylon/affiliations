Notes on data

Issues with data files
---------------------------

The file PLoS_Biol_2009_Feb_24_7(2)_e1000046.nxml has the author affiliations wrong with
them labeled as editors.

The file PLoS_Comput_Biol_2005_Aug_26_1(3)_e33.nxml doesnâ€™t have an appropriate affiliation
tag and the parsing therefore fails.

Data Issues

Article Types

A set of PLOS Bio articles from 2004-5 are labelled as research articles but
are other types (based on the <subject> tag). This is detected by a test that
seeks to ensure that research articles have an author list. This seems to be entirely in 
the date period. 

A further set have been identified that are tagged as "other" in the xml and also have
some other type in a <subject> tag. Current approach is to label these as "plos/synopsis" 
or "plos/correspondence" or similar in article_type field.

Address issues for articles from consortia

These articles from PLOS Medicine arise from consortia where the addresses are not
made available as structured data. To get a full picture it will be necessary to 
parse the unstructured affiliations from the acknowledgements section.

Corresponding author issues

A significant number of articles do not have a corresponding author properly marked. These can
be picked up via testing.They are mostly editorials, synopses or other commentaries but some 
are research articles. They are mostly concentrated in early dates and there are a relatively
small number. 

Articles with author affiliation missing
